Current Objective(s):

1. Write main runtime system and determine architecture.
>   1.001. Building Odin_Library, focusing on UI and making a lab environment in prvate.
2. Write functions for easy neural network testing. Focus on experimenting with new neuron abilities and cluster types.

General Objectives:

1. Create a baseline system to run a user interface. Visualization will provide clarity.

2. Build a machine learning function library for rapid testing.

3. Prepare work for Neural Lace, Robotic Deployment, and "Game Theory" Analytics.



Theoretical Objectives:

1. Work on a program that turns natural language into code.

2. Work on a logic "patcher" that takes intents and compiles them into mathematical statements, and then into equivalent neuron clusters.



==============================
Objectives may change with time. If an objective does not add much value to the project or is not vital to the next step of the project, it may be removed from the objective list for the time being.
